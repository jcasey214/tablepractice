    <h1>Cities I've Lived In</h1>
    <p>
      I grew up in Florida until the age of ten because my Dad's job brought us down there after I was born. Then he got a new job and moved us to the great state of Texas where I was stuck until college. I chose to attend the University of Colorado at Boulder specifically because I wanted to live here. After graduation I moved to Steamboat to snowboard for a couple years. Eventually, I thought it was time to get a real job and I moved to SLC because I had family out there. After a year, the corporate office of the company I worked for moved to Broomfield so I got to come back to Colorado. I'm now in Lakewood staying with relatives during gSchool.

    <h1>Cities I'd Like to Visit</h1>
    <p>
      I'd like to visit Tokyo because I've always been fascinated by Japanese culture. I'd like to visit Sydney because it seems like a cool city. Finally, I feel like everyone should go to Paris at some point in their life.
